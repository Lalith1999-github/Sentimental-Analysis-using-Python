# Sentimental-Analysis-using-Python
This is my project done as a part of Internship with Forsk Technologies. This solves a client problem to fetch reviews to be either positive or negative. The dash has been created with a Pie Chart showing different ratings. The dropdown has been designed to select already given reviews to know if the review is positive or negative. The final part of this gives user a chance to write a random review and which can be analyzed either positive or negative.
