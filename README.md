# Sentimental-Analysis-using-Python
This is my project done as a part of Internship with Forsk Technologies. This solves a client problem to fetch reviews to be either positive or negative. The dash has been created with a Pie Chart showing different ratings. The dropdown has been designed to select already given reviews to know if the review is positive or negative.
